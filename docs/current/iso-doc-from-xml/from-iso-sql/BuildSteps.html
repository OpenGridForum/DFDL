<h1>Build steps during artifact generation</h1>

<p>The following flowchart summarizes the build steps taken to produce the artifacts of a part or a
standard.
It uses <code>gql-standard</code> as a running example. It does not cover side-topics like staging or 
cleaning.
Please also note that this only captures the high-level dependency graph.
Dotted dependencies are strictly not needed or already indirecly implied but present to control the 
order in which targets are built or because they represent the primary source of the build step.
The exact details and additional build-related dependencies of each individual build step are not 
given here but may be found by reading the <code>Makefile</code>.</p>
