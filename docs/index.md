# Data Format Description Language (DFDL) 

This github site will be used to host some DFDL workgroup documents, tests, code-snippets and other artifacts of use to the DFDL community.

## Links

The DFDL Specification (GFD-P-R.207) is being updated.

Links to preliminary work-group draft documents are below.

## Current Working Draft

This draft of the DFDL specification has had some initial external editorial review, and changes based on that have been applied. Some of these changes are structural. Pieces of the specification have moved around, whole sections have shifted, though we've tried so far to keep primary section numbers and table numbers unchanged. (Eventually those will have to shift though, but for now they're not changed.) 

External review work stopped (so far) at page 117 of this version.

Ongoing external editorial review will be on this version.

## Delta Draft (aka R12 draft)

This draft of the DFDL specification is structurally the same as the current OGF proposed recommendation, but has all errata 5.1 to 5.63 integrated into it with change tracking on, so you can see how it has changed. We expect to keep this available for a *long* time (years) so that implementations can easily understand how DFDL evolved over the time from the Sept 2014 proposed recommendation.
