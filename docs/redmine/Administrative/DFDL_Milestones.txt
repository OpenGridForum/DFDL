We propose to produce the following documents: 

1. Formal language for DFDL structure description 
2. XML representation of this language (XML Schema, including standard APIs to reference it)
3. Requirements for DFDL ontology - what features are required of a DFDL ontology
4. Basic types ontology (floating point, integer, character etc.)
5. Basic structures ontology (Strings, arrays, tables etc.).
