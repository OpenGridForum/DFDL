# Data Format Description Language (DFDL) 

The aim of this working group is to define a language, the 
Data Format Description Language (DFDL), for describing the structure 
of binary and textual files and data streams so that their format, 
structure, and metadata can be exposed.

DFDL v1.0 is based on XML Schema but DFDL is not strongly tied to XML. 
Implementations can convert data from native form into a variety of 
representations including JSON, XML, EXI, SAX-style event callbacks, DOM-trees, etc.
