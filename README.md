# Data Format Description Language (DFDL) 

This working group has defined language, the 
Data Format Description Language (DFDL), for describing the structure 
of binary and textual files and data streams so that their format, 
structure, and metadata can be exposed.

The [DFDL v1.0 Specification](http://www.ogf.org/documents/GFD.240.pdf) is now an Open Grid Forum "Recommendation"

DFDL v1.0 is based on XML Schema but DFDL is not strongly tied to XML. 
Implementations can convert data from native form into a variety of 
representations including JSON, XML, EXI, SAX-style event callbacks, DOM-trees, etc. 

This working group maintains this standard and proposed extensions/additions to it.
